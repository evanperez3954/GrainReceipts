**Overview**

easily compare yearly data which includes account names, location, bushel counts, and customer totals. The main table 
shows year over year comparisons and how they effect the current fiscal year. Easily accessible on the page is the tally
of customers based on the selected filters.

**Key Insights**
The main focus of the dashboard is to show the total amount of bushels of a certain crop is being brought in based upon the customer,
location, and year. Gain/Loss Current Fiscal Year: Finds the total of the current year's bushels minus the previous year's bushels to
display if the current year is in a gain or loss of bushels. Total Bushels: Displays the total number of bushels for each indinvidual 
year as well as the overall total. 5 Year Average: Calculates the average of the last 5 years of total bushels. Total Customers: An 
accurate tally of the total number of unique customers based on the given filters. 

**Purpose**
This dashboard gives MKC employees the ability to understand overall grain bushel totals that will help them plan for the future as 
well as track progress and compare to the past.
